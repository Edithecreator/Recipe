        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>Beat the eggs:</span> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and
            pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water
            or milk for a fluffier texture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Heat the pan:</span> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add
            butter or oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Cook the omelette:</span> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in
            the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Add fillings (optional):</span> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but
            are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen
            fillings over one half of the omelette.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Fold and serve:</span> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift
            one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another
            minute, then slide it onto a plate.
          </li>
          <li><span>Enjoy:</span> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
